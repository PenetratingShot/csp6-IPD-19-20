    If a person's last move is betray, they are less likely to betray the next round
    As they keep betraying, they are less and less likely to betry
    If the betray past a certain threshold, it becomes more and more clear that they're just doing one move. In that case, bring them down with you

    Track how likely they are to betray as the game goes on, usually goes up
    Track how likely they are to betray the next round, usually goes down
